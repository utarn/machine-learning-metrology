# setup.ps1 — one-click environment setup for the ML for Metrology course.
# Run from the repo root in PowerShell:
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File .\setup.ps1
#
# What it does:
#   1. Installs uv (pinned version) if missing
#   2. Installs CPython 3.14 via uv
#   3. Syncs the pinned environment from uv.lock (exact versions, same on every machine)
#   4. Registers the Jupyter kernel "ml-metrology"
#   5. Runs smoke_test.py and reports ผ่าน (PASS) / ไม่ผ่าน (FAIL)
#
# Offline fallback (restricted lab network):
#   On a machine WITH internet:  uv cache prune; uv sync; copy %LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache to USB
#   On the lab machine:          set UV_CACHE_DIR to the copied cache, then: uv sync --offline
#   (see day1/environment/ notebook for the step-by-step)
